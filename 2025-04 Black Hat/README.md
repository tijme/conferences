# Call for Paper

Kong Loader is a completely new concept of loading shellcode. It prevents malware from being visible in memory *entirely* and *whatsoever*, even while executing commands, reinventing existing sleep mask techniques. For each assembly instruction, Kong Loader decrypts that specific assembly instruction, executes it, and encrypts it again. This means only the currently executing instruction is visible in memory.

It comes with dangerous benefits for offensive security experts, and with new complex challenges for defenders & malware analysts. We'll cover that all, and Kong Loader will be published right after, so you can start experimenting with it yourself.
